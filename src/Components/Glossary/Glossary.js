        <p>Here are some terms/strats that you will probably come across in your SMW speedrunning adventures.</p>
        <h3>Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Block duplication</b> is an abuse of poor collision to create extra blocks. This is done by hitting existing blocks with items at a particular position.</li>
          <li>A <b>clip</b> refers to falling through or getting stuck in any sort of solid platform.</li>
          <li><b>Cloud</b> usually refers to the item swap that gives you a cloud in your item box. For more information on this, see the CLOUD page.</li> {/* add link to /glitches/cloud */}
          <li><b>Corner boosts</b> occur when Mario hits the corner of walls or blocks while swimming upward. This gives Mario a small boost, and usually saves a frame or less.</li>
          <li><b>Fast Yoshi</b> is when Yoshi hatches quickly, which happens when you dupe a Yoshi block.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Flight</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Cannon fly</b> refers to a type of pipe fly that occurs in Mario being shot out of a cannon. This results in his speed being 64 subpixels per frame.</li>
              <li><b>Door fly</b> refers to an abuse of flight mechanics to retain flight through a door.</li>
              <li><b>Fast fly</b> is when Mario is travelling at 51 subpixels per frame. This is the fastest he can travel without cannon fly.</li>
              <li><b>Pipe fly</b> refers to an abuse of flight mechanics to retain flight through a pipe.</li>
              <li><b>Sticky fly</b> refers to an abuse of flight mechanics in which Mario sticks to a ceiling while flying.</li>
              <li><b>Yoshi fly</b> refers to an abuse of flight mechanics in which Mario enters the flying state while also riding Yoshi.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Item swapping</b> allows Yoshi to eat any sprite in the game by removing the item off of Yoshi's tongue as he is grabbing it.</li>
          <li><b>Key jumping</b> occurs when Mario jumps off of a key and grabs it on the same frame.</li>
          <li><b>Long jumps</b> are jumps in which the player taps the jump button, then regrabs and holds it. This results in a low jump and slow falling.</li>
          <li><b>Neutral jumps</b> are jumps in which the player does not hold a direction on the dpad. If executed on the frame that Mario lands, speed will not be lost.</li>
          <li>The <b>Orb</b> is a sprite that ends the level when Mario touches it. It only appears in one level naturally, but can be obtained with an item swap.</li>
          <li><b>P-switch jumps</b> happen when Mario jumps on the same frame that he lands on a p-switch. This is NOT called a yump.</li>

          <li><b>Wiggles</b> are quickly hitting left for a brief time while moving right.</li>
          <li><b>Yumps</b> happen when Mario jumps on the same frame that he lands on a switch palace switch.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Strats</h3>
